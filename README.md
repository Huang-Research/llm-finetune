# Steps to reproduce results

1) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) place multi_combined_data.json in this directory
    * TODO: this is generated by task_mgr.py in the original faultdiagnosis project. We need a static version that has been anonymized.
3) Run json2df.py to generate train.pkl, val.pkl, test.pkl
4) Run `condor_submit paper_train.job`
    * This needs to be run on `user@csci-head.cluster.cs.wwu.edu` or it will not find the H100
    * Alternatively: run `bash run.sh` for each set of args from paper_train.txt
5) Update paper_eval.txt to point to the wandb directories of each run and then run `condor_submit paper_eval.job`
